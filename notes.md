#Introduction
## Outline

- General introduction to new mutations.
- Evol. consequences of new mutations (DFE, drift, etc.)
- Deleterious variants contribute to functional variation
- Previous eâ†µorts at identifying deleterious mutations
- Maize (new mutations calcs, het groups, inbreeding depression & heterosis)

- Include these calcs or silly?
	- In US 97E6 acres x 30E3 plants/acre = 2.7E12 maize.
	- 2.7E12 maize x 90 mutations/meiosis 2.9E9 bp = 90K mut per year!
	- in US alone, each bp in genome mutates 90K times!

## Our paper

- what we do cool (GWAS/function, frequency, multiple pops)
- main findings
